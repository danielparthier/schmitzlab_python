" Visualization is a method of computing. It transforms the symbolic into the geometric,
enabling researchers to observe their simulations and computations. Visualization
offers a method for seeing the unseen. It enriches the process of scientific discovery
and fosters profound and unexpected insights. In many fields it is already
revolutionizing the way scientists do science.

"Sometimes the most effective way to describe, explore, and summarize a set of numbers 
- even a very large set - is to look at those numbers"

##

- audience, message, caption, choice of viz, no misleading plotting

## Matplotlib

- library for visualization with Python

:::{.fragment}
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

:::

- other plotting libraries: Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, Altair

## Anatomy of a figure

mapping data info into visual info

- necessary: data (y-axis elements)

- x-axis elements
- type of plot: scatter plot, line plot, histogram, bargraph, violin plot, etc.
- shape, size, and color specification
- axis ticks and labels
- legend
- title

:::

## Interfaces/ Styles of Use
- implicit pyplot interface 
  - example: plt.xlabel
  - methods are generally applied to the current axes or figure

- **object-oriented interface** 
  - example: (ax.set_xlabel)
  - uses methods on a figure or axes object to create other artists, and 
  - allows to build a visualization step by step
