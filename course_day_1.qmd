# Why would you code?

Motivation

- Saving time
- Reproducible workflow
- Flexibility
- Unlimited creativity

# Goal of today

```{.python}
// This script exports metadata information to a JSON file.
// The metadata includes the author, date, and length of the data.
// The output is saved to 'data/data_info.json'.
import json
cell_count = [1,1,4,5,2]
cell_count.sort()
list_length = len(cell_count)
output_file = 'data/data_info.json'
output_data = {
    'author': 'Doe, John',
    'date': '2025-01-10',
    'length': list_length
}
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(output_data, f)
```

- Only bring the tools you need
    - less bloated
    - few conflicts
- Only project specific packages

## Make environment

- can be done via console

``` {.bash}
python3 -m venv .venv
```
:::

- make one in VS Code
    - `CTRL + SHIFT + P` â†’ type: *env*
    - select: *Create Environment*
